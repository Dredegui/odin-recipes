	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Bolognese sauce is a classic Italian sauce for pasta
		made with ground meat such as beef or pork.
		It's slow cooked with a soffritto of onions, carrots, and celery,
		tomatoes, and milk to give it a creamy texture.
		Pronounced "bow-luh-nez,"
		the sauce comes from the Bologna region of Italy, hence the name.
